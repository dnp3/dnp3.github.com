Introduction to DNP3 
========================

DNP3 (IEEE-1815, latest revision 2012) is a SCADA protocol.  It is primarily concerned with the synchronizaton of measurement data from an outstation (aka slave) in the field to a utility master. Control requests, the canonical example being the operation of circuit breaker, are occasionally made from the master to outstation by an operator or an automated process. DNP3 can do other related tasks such as time synchronization, file transfer, etc. A full copy of the IEEE standard document is recommened as a reference for using this library. It is recommended that you at least scan a copy to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts.  This documentation is not a suitable replacement for a good working knowledge of the protocol.
