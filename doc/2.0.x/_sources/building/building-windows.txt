Windows Build
=====================

Opendnp3, the .NET bindings, and the graphical simulator may all be built using the supplied Visual Studio 2013 solution file.

Your SLN file references the ASIO_HOME environment variable, so don't forget to set it.

The default configuration on windows is to build the core C++ library as a static library.
