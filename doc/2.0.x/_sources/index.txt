The Definitive Guide to `opendnp3`_ 2.0.0-RC3

This documentation is a WIP towards the 2.0.0 final release. It may contain inconsistencies from porting it from the 1.1.x branch.

Join the `Google Group <http://groups.google.com/group/automatak-dnp3>`_ to post questions and receive updates. Help there is provided on a "as time permits" basis.

If you need dedicated commercial support, custom integration services, or compliance/security testing contact `Automatak <http://www.automatak.com>`_.

If the library does not contain a feature that you need for your device or application, please consider sponsoring the addition. We'd be happy to add standards-based additions under contract.
