What is opendnp3?
=========================

Opendnp3 is a portable, scalable, and rigorously tested implementation of DNP3 written in C++(11). The library scales to multi-core servers and down to bare-metal embedded systems. Idiomatic bindings are available for the Microsoft .NET framework and JVM-based languages (Java, Scala, Clojure, etc).

The library has been in use production since 2006. This fork is maintained and supported by Automatak, LLC. The improvements here are based on lots of user feedback and real world deployment experience.

Opendnp3 is very different from proprietary implementations. The biggest difference is the user has free access to the entire source code for the library and the associated tools like test-sets. You are free to experiment, change the code, etc, and can be as involved as you care to be in the future of the code-base. You have access to a community of experts whose collective experience and advice you can tap.
