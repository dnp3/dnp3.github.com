What is opendnp3?
=========================

Opendnp3 is a portable, scale-able, and rigorously tested implementation of DNP3 written in C++(11). The library scales to multi-core servers and down to bare-metal embedded systems. Idiomatic bindings are available for the Microsoft .NET framework.

Various forms of the library have been in use production since 2006. This fork is maintained and supported by Automatak, LLC. The improvements here are based on lots of user feedback and real world deployment experience.

Opendnp3 users have free access to the entire source code for the library and the associated tools like test-sets. You are free to experiment, change the code, etc, and can be as involved as you care to be in the future of the code-base.
